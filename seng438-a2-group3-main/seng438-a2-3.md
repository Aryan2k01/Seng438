# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to become familiar with using black-box test case design techniques and JUnit to perform unit testing. 

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The test plan is that we will test two classes in org.jfree.data: Range and DataUtilities. We want to test 5 methods from each class. For DataUtilities, we will create unit tests for all 5 methods, and we will use Mocking for its interfaces, Values2D and KeyedValues. For Range, we will create unit tests for 5 of the 15 methods: constrain(double value), contains(double value), getLowerBound(), getUpperBound(), getLength(). Since we only know the specifications of each method, our strategy will be to design the test cases using black-box test-case design techniques. 

Equivalence Class Testing was used to design test cases. To follow this technique, we first determined the independent variables and the distinct partitions. Then, we selected a number of test cases, depending on whether we were doing Strong or Weak ECT, to implement. 

The advantage of black box testing is that we can find missing functionality. However, it was inconvenient not knowing the code because it was more difficult to choose effective test cases.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Each team member created unit tests for 3-4 methods. Then, we reviewed each other's code on Github and discussed how we designed the test cases.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

It was difficult to know which test-case design technique to use and decide how to divide up the partitions. 

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

It would be easier if all the instructions for what to write in the lab report was in the same place, and not scattered throughout the instructions markdown, report markdown, and rubric.
